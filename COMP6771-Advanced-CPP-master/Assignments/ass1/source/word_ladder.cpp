    // layer that contains all the 1 hop neighbours from the current layer, whilst updating the
    // adjacency list graph in order to keep track of the parents/children. the current layer will
    // then become the new layer

    // it is worth noting that we also add ALL nodes from the forward and backward set into visited
    // as this prevents exploring paths that are not shortest path. This is because, the nodes in
    // either set are ALWAYS the shortest path nodes from the from and to words, as the search is
    // bidirectional, we want the shortest path to all intersecting words from both directions, so
    // for example if the word "hello" is in the forward set, and backwards one of the neighbours is
    // "hello", we don't want to expand the word "hello" in the backward set, as it would lead to an
    // overall longer path.

    // if we are working on the forward path, we make the children of the current node the neighbour
    // words if we are working on the backward path, we make the children of the neighbour the
    // current node this is so that during path reconstruction, we don't get the path from
    // intersecting node -> end word backwards

    // when an intersection word is found (when one of the neighbours we discover is in the other
    // directions set) then we have found the shortest path possible from start -> end and we can
    // begin reconstructing ALL solutions using DFS. This can be seen as the following front
    // neighbour = "word", back set = ["word", "hord", "bord"] etc. indicating we have the shortest
    // path from front -> word, and the shortest path from back -> word already meaning our overall
    // shortest path will intersect at "word" rather than ending the search after immediately finding
    // this word, we will expand all neighbours at this level to find ALL intersecting words, giving
    // us ALL solutions possible.

    // due to all paths having the same cost (all neighbours are 1 distance apart), and all
    // information of start/end node being available to us, bidirectional search massively increases
    // performance of this search time complexity from O(b^d) to O(b^(d/2)) where b is our branch
    // factor (average number of neighbours from each node at each depth) and d is the depth of the
    // search. Halving the search space more than halves the speed of execution as the complexity
