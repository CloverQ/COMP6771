// These tests are designed to check the behaviour on invalid input, or finding paths that are unable to be
// completed. The aim is to use our simple model to validate output, and then compare the validated simple model
// to the more complex and efficient model. It is very important to handle error cases in testing as testing
// correct input is only partially the cases we handle.

// this test simply tries to find word ladders from two words that are not in the lexicon, this behaviour should
// result in no ladders as this is impossible behaviour.

auto const english_lexicon = ::word_ladder::read_lexicon("./english.txt");
auto const ladders_efficient = ::word_ladder::generate("queen", "zxqwg", english_lexicon);
auto const ladders_correct = ::word_ladder_slow::generate_accurate("queen", "zxqwg", english_lexicon);

//  LADDER VALIDITY CHECK ON CORRECT SOLUTION
//  CHECKS 0 ladders
CHECK(std::size(ladders_correct) == 0);

//  check the optimal and correct solution match exactly
